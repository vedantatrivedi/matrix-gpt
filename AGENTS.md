# Project Rules for Codex

- Always start by reading README + package.json/pyproject + existing architecture notes.
- Prefer small, reviewable commits.
- Run tests/lint before finalizing changes.
- If a change is risky, propose the diff + rationale first.

## OpenAI docs
Always use the OpenAI developer documentation MCP server for OpenAI API / Codex / Apps SDK questions.
